# Friday the 13th
> The user enters a year and your program should output the number and dates of Friday the 13th in that given year. Try
not to rely on any Time library like for example in Ruby - Time() class and make your own methods or functions for that.

> To make it more complex, try to input not only the year but any given dates with starting Date(Month, Day, Year) and End Date and output if there is an existing one.
